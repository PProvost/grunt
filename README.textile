h1. Grunt

A warcraft addon that does those dumb menial tasks you hate doing yourself. Simply install and go. 
No configuration required.

h2. Functions

Performs the following functions for you
* Auto-repop to graveyard if in a battleground and don't have a SS
* Auto accept resurrect request
* Decline all duels (not sure this is working right now)
* Auto-accept invites from guildies or friends
* Hide that annoying "Are you sure you want to Quit?" dialog
* Skip gossip at vendors unless the ALT key is down
* Show/Hide enemy nameplates when entering/leaving combat

h2. Disabling functions

If you dont' want one of these functions, comment out the appropriate RegisterEvent
call in the PLAYER_LOGIN event handler. It should be pretty easy to figure out. :)
